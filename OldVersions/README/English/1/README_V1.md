Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_AndrOpen-Office/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate (pretty ironic for an anti-Google campaign) I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, many translations are out of date and are using an outdated version of this `README` article file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 9th 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

# The-problems-with-planned-obsolescence
An article highlighting the major problems with planned obsolescence and reasons why its practice should be banned. 

***

{{{This article still needs a lot of work - July 11th 2021}}}

## Problems with planned obsolescence

Planned obsolescence is a societal problem that is the root of several major global problems, including the 2021 semiconductor shortage, the rise of SaaS (Software as a Service) increased poverty, climate change/global warming, and more. This is mostly due to how many tens of thousands of tons of electronics are destroyed yearly due to their manufacturer making them last a lot shorter than they should in order to sell you a newer, "improved" model (with not much innovation)

The biggest bad players in this field are;

* Google

> * Samsung

* Apple

## Material shortage

We need to use our resources more conservatively. Silicon and lithium are growing scarce due to planned obsolescence, and we need to stretch out our usage for as long as possible, as we have no planet B yet, and even if we did, we still need to take care of it.

### Role in the 2021 semiconductor shortage

The solution to the semiconductor problem is an important solution. If we can fix it, it will solve multiple major problems. I can't solve it myself, it is going to take a lot of activism.

The solution is to make [Planned Obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence/) illegal. Just think about it. In this current age, there are billions of "smart" phones being produced, but hardly any of them last 3 years or longer before being replaced. There are several billion cell phones in landfills throughout the world. That includes trillions of wasted semiconductors.

This issue isn't just with "smart" phones (smart is in quotes, as these phones are not smart, that is just a brand term to distinguish touch-based devices with the older cell phones/flip phones) it also applies to laptops, desktop computers, video game consoles, TVs, and every other type of electronic. Apple and Google are just the worst offenders due to how many devices they have purposefully destroyed in order to sell you the newest phone every year, costing you ~$1000-$2000+ yearly per person (family of 5 = ~$5200-$10450+ per year is what they want from you)

If we were to design products to last, like stuff built in the 1980s, we could solve both the planned obsolescence problem, and the semiconductor shortage problems for years to come. For reference, the NES was created in 1985, and hasn't been produced since 1995, yet most of them that have been treated carefully still function in 2021, while I couldn't make a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge last for 4 years without the battery failing, the operating system no longer getting updates, the charger port failing, every button on the device breaking, and almost everything else being broken except for the screen, storage and RAM. Side note: this is also the longest I have ever had a phone last, I have gotten better over my childhood/early adulthood. It could have lasted longer if the battery hadn't failed, and the other important features didn't break.

If we are to fine Apple and Google for breaking these rules, you can't fine them $5 billion dollars or less, as this is chump change to them. We need to fine them so much that purposefully not solving the issue could bankrupt them. More like $20 billion to $50 billion per offense (in the July 8th 2021 inflation rate)

This is a societal issue. I can't fix this all by myself. More people are going to have to be willing to make the change to step into activism (or even slacktivism) everything counts. I can only further the message. My voice is not big enough to fix this alone.

## Expenses

Planned obsolescence makes companies money, but it makes struggling/somewhat stable families even more unstable economically. When a device you need has to be replaced so frequently, and costs thousands of dollars, it is not possible to keep replacing it, and it can have bad impacts that shouldn't exist in the first place.

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
